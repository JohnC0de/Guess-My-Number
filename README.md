# Guess My Number!
A simple game of guessing a number between 1 and 20, i completed the project in 3 days to learn and practice JS/CSS!

## How did I get the idea for this project?
I've seen a few similar projects, but in all of them the design was very lifeless and simple, so I came up with the idea to reference a classic toy from my childhood, the ["Brick Game"](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Game) while mantaining the gameplay core of the minigame "Guess the number"

## What did I use?
I used Vanilla JS/HTML and a CSS framework called [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)!
